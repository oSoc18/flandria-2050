                <p>
                    In July 2018, a team of five students worked together with a coach on the project Open Flandria. This project is a part of the program called Open Summer of Code. In 2018, more
                    than 70
                    students decided to participate in this program. In total, they worked on 17 projects.

                <p>
                    Open Flandria is a website where you can access a digital gallery with the open source images of sustainable housing and living. This platform was created with the help of Slim
                    Wonen
                    en
                    Leven and captures the real and existing solutions for sustainable living in Flanders. The users of the website will be able to download the images without creating an account. All
                    the
                    images are free to download and to reuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for the registered users it will be also possible to save the pictures in the custom galleries or folders. This digital gallery is meant to be used to bring awareness to
                    the
                    topic
                    and for educational purposes.

                    The goal of our project is to provide people with the open source images of sustainable housing and living. We want to make sure that in the future this platform will allow the
                    users
                    to
                    freely and without registration download and reuse those images. We wanted to create the easy-to-use website which would clear to the (potential) users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to provide attractive and high-quality images that can become a reference to everyone who is interested in the subject of sustainability and alternative ways of living.
